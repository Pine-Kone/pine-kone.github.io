Every organization runs off of some sort of an operating system.
The EOS (Entreprenurial Operating System) is an operating system that works best for organizations with "10 to 250" people. Other organizations may be able to benefit from this model, but that's who the author identifies as the most effective arena to use the model. The idea is to implement a model that everyone can get behind so that everyone is working towards the same goal on while being in sync and on the same page as others in the orgsnization. One thing I personally like about this model is that it puts value on both leadership roles and non-leadership roles for making an organization work, rsther than a lopsided or single sided focus.
