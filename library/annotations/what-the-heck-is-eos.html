Chapter 1
Every organization runs off of some sort of an operating system.
The EOS (Entreprenurial Operating System) is an operating system that works best for organizations with "10 to 250" people.
Other organizations may be able to benefit from this model, but that's who the author identifies as the most effective arena to use the model.
The idea is to implement a model that everyone can get behind so that everyone is working towards the same goal on while being in sync and on the same page as others in the organization.
One thing I personally like about this model is that it puts value on both leadership roles and non-leadership roles for making an organization work, rather than a lopsided or single sided focus.

HOW THE EOS MODEL WORKS
Organizations are made up of "6 Key Conponents":
1.) Vision - Helping everyone get on the same page for where they're going.
2.) People - Working to get the right people in the right positions.
3.) Data - Identifying those things that can be measured so performance can be evaluated.
4.) Issues - Identifying anything tha needs improvement, and putting plans in place to make those improvements.
5.) Process - Having processes documented and working to make those processes more efficient.
6.) Traction - Where the rubber meets the road. The efforts that lead to things actuslly getting done.

"Your company's goal is to be 100% strong in each of these areas.
