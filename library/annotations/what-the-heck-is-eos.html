Every organization runs off of some sort of an operating system.
The EOS (Entreprenurial Operating System) is an operating system that works best for organizations with "10 to 250" people.
Other organizations may be able to benefit from this model, but that's who the author identifies as the most effective arena to use the model.
The idea is to implement a model that everyone can get behind so that everyone is working towards the same goal on while being in sync and on the same page as others in the organization.
One thing I personally like about this model is that it puts value on both leadership roles and non-leadership roles for making an organization work, rather than a lopsided or single sided focus.
HOW THE EOS MODEl WORKS
Organizations are made up of "6 Key Conponents":
1.) Vision
2.) People
3.) Data
4.) Issues
5.) Process
6.) Traction

"Your company's gosl is to be 100% strong in each of these areas.0
